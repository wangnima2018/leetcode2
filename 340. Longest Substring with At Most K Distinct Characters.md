Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.

Two pointer is actually a moving window. Whenever we add new right element, we re-check if condition get satisfied based on left index. If not, we keep 
increase left index until we find new condition.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # this is smart, if either one is 0, we return 0
        n = len(s)
        if n * k == 0:
            return 0

        # sliding window left and right pointers
        l, r = 0, 0
        # hashmap character -> its rightmost position
        # in the sliding window
        hashmap = defaultdict(int)

        max_len = -sys.maxsize
        count = 0
        
        while r < n:
            hashmap[s[r]] += 1
            r += 1
            count += 1
            while len(hashmap) > k:
                hashmap[s[l]] -= 1
                count -= 1
                if hashmap[s[l]] == 0:
                    del hashmap[s[l]]
                l += 1
            max_len = max(max_len, count)
        return max_len
