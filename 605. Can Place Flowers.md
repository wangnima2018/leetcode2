<p>
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
Note:
The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

interate through flowerbed, figure out if i-1 is occupied and i + 1 is occupied.
if not, check if i == 1, if not, we can plant on i, increase counter by 1.

        for i, v in enumerate(flowerbed):
            if v: continue
            if i > 0 and flowerbed[i - 1]: continue
            if i < len(flowerbed) - 1 and flowerbed[i + 1]: continue

            flowerbed[i] = 1
        return ans >= n
