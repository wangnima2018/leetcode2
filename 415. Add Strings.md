Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
Example 3:

Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"

To make the calculation easy, we can reverse the digits in both numbers. Then we add two numbers together with each matching digit
(ex: the first digit of num1 and first digit of num2). Loop though num1 and num2 by each digit, if for one number, there's no corresponding digit, 
we put 0 as a placeholder. For each round, we calculate current sum and carryover value. Finally, we reverse the string as final result.

```python
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        
        num1R = num1[::-1]
        num2R = num2[::-1]
        
        i = j = 0
        carry = 0
        res = ""
        
        while i < len(num1R) or j < len(num2R):
            if i < len(num1R):
                cur1 = int(num1R[i])
            else:
                cur1 = 0
            if j < len(num2R):
                cur2 = int(num2R[j])
            else:
                cur2 = 0
            res = res + str((cur1 + cur2 + carry) % 10)
            # be careful about floor division --  //
            carry = (cur1 + cur2 + carry) // 10
            
            i += 1
            j += 1
        if carry != 0:
            res = res + str(carry)
        return res[::-1]
