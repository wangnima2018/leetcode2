<h3>题意<h3>
<p>
You are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where:

horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, and
verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.
Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 109 + 7.

<h3>解题<h3>
<p> 
    #When you break down the problem, you realize that you don't have to find the area of each piece, 
    just the largest gap between two cuts in both horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. 
    #And while you can check the distance from 0 to the first cut by initializing 
    your prevCut pointer to 0, you also need to check the distance from the last cut to the height/width.

    And while you can check the distance from 0 to the first cut by initializing 
    your prevCut pointer to 0, you also need to check the distance from the last cut to the height/width.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:

    #When you break down the problem, you realize that you don't have to find the area of each piece, just the largest gap between two cuts in both horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. 
    #And while you can check the distance from 0 to the first cut by initializing your prevCut pointer to 0, you also need to check the distance from the last cut to the height/width.
        maxH = self.getMaxPieceLength(h, horizontalCuts)
        maxW = self.getMaxPieceLength(w, verticalCuts)
        return (maxH * maxW) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        #return maxH * maxW
		
    def getMaxPieceLength(self, cakeLength: int, cuts: List[int])-> int:
        maxPieceLength = prevCut = 0
        for cut in sorted(cuts):
            if cut - prevCut > maxPieceLength:
                maxPieceLength = cut - prevCut
            prevCut = cut
        # don't forget this corner case, the edge to last cut also counts
        if cakeLength - prevCut > maxPieceLength:
                maxPieceLength = cakeLength - prevCut
        return maxPieceLength
