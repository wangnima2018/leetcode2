<p>
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

Given the condition that array is already sort, we can use binary search to find (target - numbers[i]).

for i in xrange(len(numbers)-1):

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        for i in xrange(len(numbers)-1):
            target1 = target - numbers[i]
            res = self.binarySearch(numbers,target1,i+1,len(numbers)-1)
            if res > 0:
                # 注意，return的是位置，不是下标，所以要加一
                return [i+1,res+1]
            
        
    def binarySearch(self,numbers,target,start,end):
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) / 2
            if numbers[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif  numbers[mid] > target:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        if numbers[start] == target:
            return start
        elif numbers[end] == target:
            return end
        else:
            return -1
