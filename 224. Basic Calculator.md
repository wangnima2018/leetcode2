Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

Example 1:

Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
Note:
You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
Do not use the eval built-in library function.

<p>iterate through the string with reverse order. if current digit is number, append. if i equal to 0 or current digit 
is not number, then get the current operand. handle the operator [) + -] together. Handle the "(" with stack ele pop up.
####### operands/operators array is act as stack<p>

                operators.pop()
        
        # based on if there's operators, to decide if all the calculation has been done, good
        while operators:

        op = operators.pop()
        if op == '+':
            operands.append(left + right)
