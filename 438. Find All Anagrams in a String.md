<h3>题意<h3>
<p>
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

 # 对应于每一位，如果d里面刚好还有对应的元素，那么count就减少1
        # 有一个window，对应于window，进行扫描
        # 每扫描一个元素，进行一次记录

```python
 ls, lp = len(s), len(p)
        count = lp
        cp = collections.Counter(p)
        ans = []
        for i in range(ls):
            if cp[s[i]] >=1 :
                count -= 1
            cp[s[i]] -= 1
            if i >= lp:
                if cp[s[i - lp]] >= 0:
                    count += 1
                cp[s[i - lp]] += 1
            if count == 0:
                ans.append(i - lp + 1)
        return ans
