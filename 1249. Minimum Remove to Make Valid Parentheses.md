Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters. 

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
Example 4:

Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
Output: "a(b(c)d)"

This problem check if you understand how to use stack. There are differnt situations. if we hit left bracket, then we add index to stack. If we hit 
right bracket but there's not left bracket, then we need to remove the right bracket, otherwise, we just need to pop the stack element. Lastly, for 
every element in stack and every element we recorded in index_to_remove set, we combine those by union and remove those index one by one.

index_to_remove = index_to_remove.union(set(stack))

```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        index_to_remove = set()
        stack = []
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in "()":
                continue
            elif c == "(":
                stack.append(i)
            elif not stack:
                index_to_remove.add(i)
            else:
                stack.pop()
        
        index_to_remove = index_to_remove.union(set(stack))
        res = []
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if i not in index_to_remove:
                res.append(c)
        return "".join(res)            
        
    

```
