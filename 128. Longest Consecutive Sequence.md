Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

use dictionary to save all the element value and if that element has been visited.
Whenever find an unvisited element, go right and go left, to find longest range.

 maxLen = max(maxLen,lenL+1+lenR)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        d = {}
        for e in nums:
            d[e] = False
        
        maxLen = 0
        for e in d:
            if d[e] == False:
                cur = e + 1
                lenR = 0
                while cur in d:
                    lenR += 1
                    d[cur] = True
                    cur += 1
                    
                cur = e - 1
                lenL = 0
                while cur in d:
                    lenL += 1
                    d[cur] = True
                    cur -= 1
                    
                maxLen = max(maxLen,lenL+1+lenR)
        return maxLen
