Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
Example 2:

Input: "aba"
Output: False
Example 3:

Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)

kind of like brute force solution. get substring within len/2, and check if each substring can be repeat till end.

```python

    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for i in range(1,len(s)/2+1):
            cur = s[:i]
            curL = len(cur)
            curIndex = curL
            while curIndex < len(s):
                if cur == s[curIndex:curIndex+curL]:
                    curIndex = curIndex + curL
                else:
                    break
            if curIndex >= len(s):
                return True
        return False
