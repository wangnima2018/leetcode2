You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.
  
  
  Example 1:

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs):
        """
        :type logs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        letters = []
        nums = []
        for log in logs:
            logsp = log.split(" ")
            if logsp[1].isalpha():
                letters.append((" ".join(logsp[1:]), logsp[0]))
            else:
                nums.append(log)
        letters.sort()
        return [letter[1] + " " + letter[0] for letter in letters] + nums
    

```
