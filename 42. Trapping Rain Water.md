<h3>题意<h3>
<p>Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.


The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

<h3>解题<h3>
<p>本题的本质是Sum of:  min(max(leftToTheCurrent,rightToTheCurrent)) - currentHeight<p>




<h3>细节<h3>
<p>找到可以累加的边界是：for i in range(1,length-1):<p>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        length = len(height)
        if height is None or len(height) == 0 or len(height) == 1:
            return 0
        leftMax = [0] * length
        rightMax = [0] * length
        max = height[0]
        for i in range(1,length-1):
            if height[i-1] > max:
                leftMax[i] = height[i-1]
                max = height[i-1]
            else:
                leftMax[i] = max
        
        max = height[length-1]
        for i in range(length-2,0,-1):
            if height[i+1] > max:
                rightMax[i] = height[i+1]
                max = height[i+1]
            else:
                rightMax[i] = max
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(1,length-1):
            if leftMax[i] > height[i] and rightMax[i] > height[i]:
                cur = min(leftMax[i],rightMax[i]) - height[i]
                res += cur
        return res
        

```
