Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.

<h3>解题<h3>
<p>
针对于Obstacle,如果在初始行，初始列的时候找到了，那么之后的行格子，列格子，只能归0了
同样，如果在一维DP中，找到了Obstacle,当前的二维矩阵格子归零
