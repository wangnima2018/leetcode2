<h3>题意<h3>
<p>
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degrees to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 

Example 1:

Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Example 2:

Input: instructions = "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves north indefinitely.
Example 3:

Input: instructions = "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...

Algorithm

Let's use numbers from 0 to 3 to mark the directions: north = 0, east = 1, south = 2, west = 3. In the array directions we could store corresponding coordinates changes, i.e. directions[0] is to go north, directions[1] is to go east, directions[2] is to go south, and directions[3] is to go west.

The initial robot position is in the center x = y = 0, facing north idx = 0.

Now everything is ready to iterate over the instructions.

If the current instruction is R, i.e. to turn on the right, the next direction is idx = (idx + 1) % 4. Modulo here is needed to deal with the situation - facing west, idx = 3, turn to the right to face north, idx = 0.

If the current instruction is L, i.e. to turn on the left, the next direction could written in a symmetric way idx = (idx - 1) % 4. That means we have to deal with negative indices. A more simple way is to notice that 1 turn to the left = 3 turns to the right: idx = (idx + 3) % 4.

If the current instruction is to move, we simply update the coordinates: x += directions[idx][0], y += directions[idx][1].

After one cycle we have everything to decide. It's a limit cycle trajectory if the robot is back to the center: x = y = 0 or if the robot doesn't face north: idx != 0.

    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        #north = 0, east = 1, south = 2, west = 3

        x = y = 0
        
        idx = 0
        
        for i in instructions:

                idx = (idx + 3) % 4
            elif i == "R":
                idx = (idx + 1) % 4
            else:
                x += directions[idx][0]
                y += directions[idx][1]
                
        
        return (x==0 and y==0) or idx != 0
