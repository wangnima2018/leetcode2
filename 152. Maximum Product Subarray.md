<p>
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
<p>




<h3>解题<h3>
<p>
Use 2 variables prodMax, prodMin to keep record to current (i) Max and Min value.
For each round, update the Max, Min value（if current number is negative, swap max/min value）. Also, update max value (ans)

<h3>细节<h3>

how to init:
ans = prodMax = prodMin = nums[0]
<p>


```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # we need to keep cur_max and cur_min, bot values can contribute to next max
        # for each round, we also need to compare the min and max against current value, since 
        # there's some cases, we can drop all the previous values:
        """
        This value will be picked if the accumulated product has been really bad (even compared to the current number). This can happen when the current number has a preceding zero (e.g. [0,4]) or is preceded by a single negative number (e.g. [-3,5]).
        
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        
        cur_max = nums[0]
        cur_min = nums[0]
        res = cur_max
        
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            cur = nums[i]
            # to avoid cur_max value update influence cur_min value, need a temp var
            cur_max_temp = max(cur, cur_max * cur, cur_min * cur)
            cur_min = min(cur, cur_max * cur, cur_min * cur)
            cur_max = cur_max_temp
            res = max(res, cur_max)

        return res

```
