Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

Example 1:
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.

use three variables, a, b, c to keep track of the top 3 element. 
compare n with a, b and c to update a,b,c in each round.

```python

        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = b = c = -sys.maxint
        for n in nums:
            if n > a:
                a, b, c = n, a, b
            elif a > n > b:
                b , c = n , b
            elif b > n > c:
                c = n
        if c != -sys.maxint:
            return c
        else:
            return a
