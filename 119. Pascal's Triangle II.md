Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

Use recursion. Each time, for each row, the rule is 
return [1] + [A[i]+A[i+1] for i in range(len(A)-1)] + [1] 
Also, learned how to add different list to one list:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getRow(self, rowIndex):
        """
        :type rowIndex: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
    
        if rowIndex == 0:
            return [1]
        A = self.getRow(rowIndex-1)
        return [1] + [A[i]+A[i+1] for i in range(len(A)-1)] + [1]

```
