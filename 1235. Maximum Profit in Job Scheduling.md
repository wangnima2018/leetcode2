We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].

You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

 

Example 1:



Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
Example 2:



Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
Example 3:



Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109
1 <= profit[i] <= 104

This is a typical DP problem, need DP solution. We check from end to beginning: if we can find a interval end that is within certain range of sorted start value,
we treat it as a feasible soluion for  s1----e1, s2----e2, then we compare the max: dp[i] = max( dp[i+1], X[i][2] + dp[j] )

j = bisect.bisect_left(startTimeSorted,X[i][1],i+1)

```python
class Solution:
    def jobScheduling(self, startTime: List[int], endTime: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:
        X = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime, profit), key = lambda x: x[0])
        startTimeSorted = [x[0] for x in X ]
        n = len(X)
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            # we are trying to find the start index j, which X[i][1] is less than (meaning ith end time is 
            # less than j beginning time)
            j = bisect.bisect_left(startTimeSorted,X[i][1],i+1) #only search in indices to the right of i
            dp[i] = max( dp[i+1], X[i][2] + dp[j] )
        return dp[0]
    

```
