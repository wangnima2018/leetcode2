Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

 

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
 

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:

          1
         / 
        2          
 

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1          
 

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []

<p>use a while loop to check if only root is there , not there's child. if there's child, then 
iteration through the left/right node, if current node don't have any l/r, then append. Otherwise, recursion to next level.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findLeaves(self, root):

        res = []
        if root is None:
            return res

            cur = []
            self.helper(root,cur)
            res.append(cur)
        res.append([root.val])

                cur.append(r.val)
                root.right = None
            if r.left is not None or r.right is not None:
                self.helper(r,cur)
