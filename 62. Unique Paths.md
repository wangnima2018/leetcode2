<h3>题意<h3>
<p>A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?
<p>

<p>一维递归问题，递推公式： 
mat[i][j] = mat[i-1][j] + mat[i][j-1]
<p>


```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        mat = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]
        for i in range(n):
            mat[0][i] = 1
        for i in range(m):
            mat[i][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                mat[i][j] = mat[i-1][j] + mat[i][j-1]
        
        return mat[m-1][n-1]
```
