You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1]. pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. For example, for w = [1, 3], the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).

 

Example 1:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.
Example 2:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.

<h3>解题<h3>

Given array of numbers, each number map to weight and we need to pick the number randomly, but given the consideration of weight. 
The solution is to record each sum value from 0 - i. If we pick a random value within total sum, then we know it's proportional to the probability it
will be picked. Next step is find the relation between random value to each array of sum numbers. One linear solution is check the sum value againt random 
value one by one. If we find the first random value less than sum value, we return sum value index. But we can also use binary search to save run time.

alternative for binary search:
return bisect.bisect_left(self.prefix_sums, target)
<p>

 
```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sums = []
        prefix_sum = 0
        for weight in w:
            prefix_sum += weight
            self.prefix_sums.append(prefix_sum)
        self.total_sum = prefix_sum
        

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        target = self.total_sum * random.random()
        # binary search
        low = 0
        high = len(self.prefix_sums)
        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) //2
            if target > self.prefix_sums[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return low

```
