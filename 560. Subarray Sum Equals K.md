Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-107 <= k <= 107
<p>




<h3>解题<h3>

Whenever we hit some question like find continous subarray, we can get sum total from 1 to i. In this problem, we keep tracking sum total, 
then we check if current sum total minus previous sum totalk equal to sum number K. If yes, we increase the count value.

corner case: d[0] = 1 # this is the senario like nums = [1,1], k = 2. So we need a place holder for and total number 0, current count is 1.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """

        count = 0 
        total = 0
        d = collections.defaultdict(int)
        d[0] = 1 # this is the senario like nums = [1,1], k = 2
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # record total number sum from 1 to index i
            total += nums[i]

            if total - k in d:
                count += d[total-k] # this make sense because there might be multiple previous sum correspond to this value

            # keep tracking each total number, key as cur total, value as count of number like total. 
            d[total] +=  1 
        return count

    

```
