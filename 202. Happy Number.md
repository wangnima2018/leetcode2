Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

<p>use while loop to find out if the number is happy number or not. 
            for i in range(len(curStr)):
                cur += int(curStr[i]) * int(curStr[i])
   if cur == 1, means find the happy number, break.
